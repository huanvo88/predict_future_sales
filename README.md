These are the jupyter notebooks used in the Coursera Course [How to Win a Data Science Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales) hosted on Kaggle:

* [EDA.ipynb](EDA.ipynb): initial EDA and feature engineering, which creates sliding-window features
* [Gridsearch.ipynb](Gridsearch.ipynb): build model to predict future sales, which involves Bayesian grid search for xgboots, catboost, lightgbm; ensemble models, and stacking.

Future steps: try [pycaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret) time series module.
